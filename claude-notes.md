## Current Step: Final Refinements Complete ✅
*If starting from fresh session, reread the project:init-app command file*

## Status: All Feedback Implemented & Final Refinements Complete
- ✅ Gathered requirements from user
- ✅ Asked clarifying questions
- ✅ Planned and implemented MVP
- ✅ Received user feedback
- ✅ Implemented all feedback improvements
- ✅ Received final refinement requests
- ✅ Implemented all final refinements
- ✅ Tested all changes thoroughly

## App Description:
Documentation website for Code Bloom with:
- Landing page (template overview + links)
- Setup instructions page (Windows/macOS/Linux tabs)
- Template usage page
- Interactive code blocks with user input fields
- Copy-to-clipboard buttons for code snippets
- Public access (no auth required, but keep auth infrastructure)

## User Feedback Implemented:
- ✅ **Rebranded to "Code Bloom"** throughout site (removed all "Fullstack Vibe Coding Template" references)
- ✅ **Updated home page**: Used code-bloom.svg icon, removed "what's included" section
- ✅ **Redesigned setup page**: More obvious tabs (tabs-boxed style), integrated platform-specific guides, better styling with numbered steps and icons
- ✅ **Streamlined usage page**: Removed separate Convex/Claude steps (now part of pnpm run init), removed "pro tip" and "What happens during initialization" sections
- ✅ **Added interactive code blocks**: Users can input name/email for git config, username/repo name for cloning
- ✅ **Made content more terse**: Removed unnecessary explanatory text

## Final Refinements Implemented:
- ✅ **Removed redundant text**: Eliminated "Get your development environment ready to use Code Bloom" and similar redundant descriptions
- ✅ **Increased input text size**: Removed input-sm class to make input fields more prominent and easier to use
- ✅ **Added mkdir command**: All platforms now show `mkdir ~/projects` command instead of just instructional text
- ✅ **Removed homebrew recommendation**: No longer suggesting optional Homebrew installation on macOS
- ✅ **Removed curl/git installation**: Eliminated unnecessary curl and git installation instructions from Linux setup
- ✅ **Made selected tab more obvious**: Active tab now has primary background and primary-content text for clear visual distinction
- ✅ **Moved icon to top right**: Code Bloom icon is now a circular button in the navbar-end position

## Testing Results:
- ✅ All branding updated to "Code Bloom"
- ✅ Code Bloom SVG icon displays correctly in top right corner
- ✅ Setup page tabs work with enhanced visual distinction for active tab
- ✅ Interactive input fields update code blocks dynamically
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality works perfectly
- ✅ Mobile responsive design works properly
- ✅ All navigation works on both desktop and mobile
- ✅ Streamlined usage flow with 4 clear steps
- ✅ mkdir commands display properly in all platform guides

- ✅ No homebrew or unnecessary installation instructions
- ✅ All redundant text successfully removed
