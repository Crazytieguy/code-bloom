# Claude Notes - Template Customization

## Current Session: Usage Page Enhancement
Added documentation for custom commands to the usage page to help users understand available /project: commands.

## What Was Done:
✅ Added custom commands section to usage page (`src/routes/usage.tsx`)
✅ Documented four main commands: init-app, customize-theme, deploy-vercel, generate-report
✅ Used InteractiveCodeBlock components for copyable commands
✅ Added clear descriptions and usage instructions
✅ Committed changes with appropriate git message

## Previous Session: Custom Command Creation
Created a custom Claude Code slash command for generating session reports focused on collaboration insights.

✅ Created `/generate-report` command at `.claude/commands/generate-report.md`
✅ Designed command to extract generalizable lessons about Claude Code workflows
✅ Focused on human-AI collaboration patterns rather than specific implementation details
✅ Made command terse and non-prescriptive to allow contextual adaptation

## Files Updated:
- `src/routes/usage.tsx` - Added custom commands section with documentation
- Previous: `.claude/commands/generate-report.md` - Custom report generation command

## Next Steps:
- Template is ready with comprehensive usage documentation
- Users can discover and use custom commands through the usage page
