## Current Work
- Working on Code Bloom template project
- Focus: Community features and documentation
- COMPLETED: Interactive diagram with ALL requested custom logos and perfect light/dark mode theming

## Status
- Project is running with development servers active
- All auth features working with Clerk in production
- Interactive diagram on home page shows:
  - Developer workflow components
  - Development tools (Claude Code, Node.js, Vite, etc.)
  - Cloud services (GitHub, Vercel, Convex, Clerk, etc.)
  - How everything connects together
  - Click-to-explore functionality
  - Side panel for connection flow (always visible, left-aligned text)
  - ALL CUSTOM LOGOS IMPLEMENTED:
    - Convex: Multi-colored geometric logo (yellow/red/purple)
    - Anthropic: Letter "A" logo in dark color
    - Node.js: Green hexagon logo with proper Node.js branding
    - Claude Code: Orange Claude logo
    - Chrome: Full color Google Chrome logo for both browsers
    - Vite: Purple/yellow gradient lightning bolt
    - Clerk: Circular gradient logo (removed text as requested)
    - Vercel: Triangle logo
    - Namecheap: Gradient logo with orange/red colors
  - Brighter colors for File System (blue) and Terminal (purple)
  - Always-visible connection flow panel (no layout shift)
  - Left-aligned text in connection descriptions
  - Positioned below page navigation links as requested

## Important Context
- Using Convex for backend with auth configured
- TanStack Router for navigation
- DaisyUI for styling (v5 with Tailwind CSS 4)
- Authentication uses Clerk with Convex integration

## Key Files
- `/src/routes/` - All page routes
- `/convex/` - Backend functions
- `/src/components/` - Reusable components
- `/src/components/DevelopmentFlowDiagram.tsx` - Interactive diagram component with custom icons
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines

## Next Steps
- User will provide feedback on connection descriptions
- Consider adding more interactive features
- Expand community report functionality
- Improve documentation and examples
